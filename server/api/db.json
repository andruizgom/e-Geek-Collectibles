The scene where, unable to kill Frodo, Gollum leads the unsuspecting Hobbit to the lair of the spider demon Shelob! Prime1 Studio skillfully captures the moment when a vulnerable but brave Frodo Baggins ventures into Cirith Ungol, unaware of the betrayal that is about to befall him. Gollum incites Frodo to enter the spider's lair; his plan is to steal the ring from Frodo after he has fallen prey to the spider demon. The sudden concern on Frodo's face and Gollum's malicious intent to harm him have been captured by the talented sculptors at Prime1 Studio. They used synthetic hair not only on Frodo's Hobbit feet but also on Gollum's head to enhance the statue's superior quality.",
